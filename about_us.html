									<p>
										Shangri-La LLC is a trusted provider of human services, passionately dedicated to supporting individuals with physical, intellectual, and developmental disabilities, as well as those living with behavioral, emotional, and psychiatric conditions. We believe that every person deserves the opportunity to lead a fulfilling life with dignity, choice, and connection—and our mission is to make that a reality through inclusive, person-centered care.
									</p>									
									<p>
										Founded on the principles of compassion, respect, and innovation, Shangri-La LLC offers a wide range of services including Individualized Family Support Living, Community Participation Services, Respite Care, and Nursing Services. Our highly trained staff work in partnership with individuals and families to build customized plans that reflect each person's unique needs, goals, and potential.
									</p>
									<p>
										We are more than just a service provider—we are a community advocate. Our programs are designed not only to support individuals in their daily lives but also to promote meaningful participation in society. Whether it's accessing education, pursuing employment, engaging in recreational activities, or connecting with peers, we empower people to live as independently and confidently as possible.
									</p>
									<p>
										At Shangri-La LLC, we believe that true empowerment comes from inclusion. That’s why we work diligently to remove barriers and bridge gaps between individuals and their communities. Through strong partnerships with local organizations, advocacy groups, and service systems, we promote full community integration and sustainable support networks that uplift everyone involved.
									</p>
									<p>
										Our team is the heart of everything we do. Every staff member at Shangri-La LLC is trained not only in best practices but also in empathy, cultural competence, and trauma-informed care. We foster a positive, collaborative work environment where passion and purpose drive our efforts. Our staff form meaningful relationships with the individuals and families we serve—relationships built on trust, consistency, and mutual respect.
									</p>
									<p>
										We also believe in the power of continuous improvement. Through ongoing training, innovation, and community feedback, we stay at the forefront of care models and service delivery. We are committed to refining our practices and embracing new tools and strategies that enhance the lives of those we serve.
                                    </p>
									<p>
Looking ahead, Shangri-La LLC strives to be a leader in human services—not only in the quality of care we provide but also in shaping a more inclusive, compassionate society. We envision communities where everyone, regardless of ability, has the resources and opportunities to thrive.
									</p>
									<p>Together, we’re building a more inclusive world—one person, one family, and one community at a time.</p>
